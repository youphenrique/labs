Hello! I'm Alexander Maxwell, a passionate software developer with a love for building impactful and efficient digital solutions. I specialize in creating web and backend applications that are not only functional but also thoughtfully designed.

With a background in computer science and several years of hands-on experience, I've worked across a range of technologies and frameworks. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and continually learning new tools to stay ahead in a fast-paced industry.

### What I Do

- **Web Development** – I build responsive, user-friendly web applications using modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue.
- **Backend Engineering** – I design robust and scalable APIs using Node.js, Python, and cloud-native services (AWS, Firebase).
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** – I have experience deploying applications using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform.
- **Database Design** – I work with both relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, DynamoDB) databases.

### My Philosophy

I believe in solving real-world problems through thoughtful software design. Whether it’s improving user experience or automating tedious workflows, I strive to build tools that make a difference.

Collaboration, continuous learning, and a curiosity-driven mindset are at the heart of how I work.

### Outside of Code

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring coffee shops, hiking trails, or reading about design, psychology, and technology trends. I'm always open to a good conversation — feel free to [reach out](mailto:your.email@example.com)!
